## Quick Start

Get your development environment up and running in minutes:

<Steps>
<Step title="Clone or Create Project">

Use the Weaverse CLI to create a new theme:

```bash
npx @weaverse/cli@latest create --template=pilot --project-id=your-project-id
```

Or clone an existing theme repository:

```bash
git clone your-theme-repository
cd your-theme-directory
```

</Step>

<Step title="Install Dependencies">

```bash
npm install
```

</Step>

<Step title="Configure Environment">

Create a `.env` file with your Weaverse and Shopify credentials:

```bash
# Core Variables
SESSION_SECRET="your-session-secret"
PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN="your-store.myshopify.com"
PUBLIC_STOREFRONT_API_TOKEN="your-storefront-api-token"
WEAVERSE_PROJECT_ID="your-weaverse-project-id"

# Optional: Use demo data during development
# PUBLIC_STORE_DOMAIN="mock.shop"
```

</Step>

<Step title="Start Development Server">

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your storefront will be available at `http://localhost:3456`

</Step>
</Steps>

npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run preview      # Build and start production
```

### Code Quality
```bash
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript checking
npm run lint         # Check code quality
npm run format       # Format code

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Port 3456 Already in Use">
    ```bash
    # Kill any process using port 3456
    npx kill-port 3456
    
    # Or start on a different port
    npm run dev -- --port 3457
    ```
    *Note: If you change the port, update the Preview URL in Weaverse Studio accordingly*
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Environment Variables Not Working">
    - Ensure `.env` file is in the project root (same level as `package.json`)
    - Check variable names are exactly correct (case-sensitive)
    - Restart development server after any `.env` changes
    - Verify no spaces around the `=` sign in environment variables
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Studio Preview Not Loading">
    - Verify development server is running on port 3456
    - Check that `http://localhost:3456` loads in your browser
    - Ensure no firewall is blocking port 3456
    - Try refreshing the Studio page
