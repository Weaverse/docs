# Weaverse MCP

Access Weaverse documentation and knowledge directly through your favorite AI tools with the Weaverse MCP server.

## About MCP Servers

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that creates standardized connections between AI applications and external services, like documentation. The Weaverse MCP server enables AI assistants like Claude, Cursor, and others to search Weaverse documentation directly, delivering accurate, context-aware assistance for developers working with Weaverse products.

Your MCP server exposes tools for AI applications to search the Weaverse knowledge base and find relevant information, code examples, API references, and implementation guides.

## Accessing the Weaverse MCP Server

The Weaverse MCP server is automatically hosted at:

```
https://docs.weaverse.io/mcp
```

This HTTP-based server is always available and requires no installation or setup. Simply connect your AI tools to this URL to start accessing Weaverse documentation.

<Note>
  The MCP server is publicly available and automatically generated from the Weaverse documentation.

    3. The Weaverse documentation will be accessible in your coding sessions

    Refer to the [Claude Code MCP guide](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/mcp) for detailed setup instructions.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Cursor">
    To configure Cursor manually:

    1. Open Cursor Settings (âŒ˜/Ctrl + ,)
    2. Navigate to **Extensions** > **MCPs**
    3. Add a new MCP server with:
       - **Name**: `weaverse`
       - **URL**: `https://docs.weaverse.io/mcp`

    Or use the contextual menu "Connect to Cursor" option for automatic setup.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="VS Code">
    To configure VS Code:

    1. Install an MCP-compatible extension (e.g., Continue, Cody)
    2. Add the Weaverse MCP server in your extension settings:
       - **Server URL**: `https://docs.weaverse.io/mcp`

    Or use the contextual menu "Connect to VS Code" option for automatic setup.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

</CardGroup>

### Example Queries

Here are some example questions you can ask your AI assistant with the Weaverse MCP enabled:

```
How do I set up a new Weaverse Hydrogen theme?

What's the difference between 'settings' and 'inspector' in component schemas?

How do I use the createSchema() function?

Show me examples of the useWeaverse hook

What are the available input types for component settings?

How do I implement data fetching in a Weaverse section?

What props does the WeaverseRoot component accept?
```

## How It Works

When you ask a question about Weaverse in your AI tool:

1. **Recognition**: The AI assistant recognizes your question is about Weaverse
2. **Query**: It calls the Weaverse MCP server with your query
3. **Search**: The MCP server searches the Weaverse documentation using the SearchWeaverse tool
4. **Return**: Relevant documentation with links is returned to the AI assistant
5. **Response**: The AI formulates an accurate response based on official documentation

This process ensures responses are accurate and based on the latest Weaverse documentation.
